What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was a bit confusing to translate the codes into object-oriented way. At first, I set up the computer file and it went well. However, when trying to call the computer class object created in the computer.py file, the problem happened. We tried to call this object by using several ways, like get_function or import command. Straining my brain for more than two hours, I eventually went to ask help to Professor Crouser on the next day. I realized that I should create the objects also in the oo_resale_shop.py file, not only in the computer.py file. I would give other students an advice to better understand how the main function and objects interact each other, before writing code.
